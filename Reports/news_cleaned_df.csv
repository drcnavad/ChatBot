We still have work to do over the next several months, but I’m very pleased with the performance and outlook we have.”Despite the projected revenue decline, UnitedHealth said it expected profit to grow and slightly top the current average forecast of analysts.",Yahoo,-0.9999151229858398,negative,Finnhub
